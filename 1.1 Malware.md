Chapter 9: Threats, Attacks and Vulnerabilities.

# Overview of Malware (Malicious Software)

### Malware:
   > is used to refer to **software** that does harm **intentionally** (such as a virus) or **unintentionally** (such as poorly written code).
   
   **Bad:** Gather Information (keystrokes), controlled over the net, show advertising, viruses and worms. 

### Software Exploitation:
-  Viruses
-	**Crypto-malware:** is a subset of malware which incorporates cryptography.
-	**Ransomware:** takes control of a system and demands that a third party be paid. (often through Trojan)
-	**Worms:** primary focus on spreading and can function as a stand-alone entity.
-	**Trojan Horse:** is a program that enters a system or network under the **guise** of another program. (eg. attachment, installation program, creates backdoor, replaces a valid program during installation) <br />Common filename extensions for email attachments should *not* be allowed: *.bat, .com, .exe, .hlp, .pif, .scr*
-	**Rootkit:** is a program that can hide certain things from the operating system. (With rootkit, processes may be running on the system without showing up in Task Manager.)
-	**Keylogger:** is a software that records keystrokes pressed into a log file, then allows review the logs so that passwords and sensitive data can be seen.
-	**Adware:** the malware applications deliver ads.
-    **Spyware:** is spread to machines by users who inadvertently ask for it. Spyware program monitors the the user's activity and reports it to another party without informing the user. (There are many legal uses for it. Also, there are illegal manner to use it.)
-	**Botnet/Bots**: Software running on infected computers called zombies. (Some can be easily detected by looking at a database of known threats.)
-    **RAT:** *Remote Administration Tool* allows a remote user to access the system for the purpose of administering it. (legal/illegal, eg. <a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gh0st_RAT">GhostRat</a> is one of the most dangerous exploits.)
-    **Logic Bomb:** are programs or code snippets that don't begin the attack, but tell the attacker that the victim has met the needed criteria or state for an attack to begin.
-    **Backdoor:** Two diffrent meanings. (eg. <a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Orifice">Back Orifice</a> and <a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBus">NetBus</a>)<br />Original term refers to troubleshooting and developer hooks into systems that often circumvented normal authentication.<br />Second type refers to gaining access to a network and inserting a program or utility that creates an entrance for an attacker.

### How you get malware:

<p> > **1. Work together:** A worm takes advantage of a vulnerability, installs malware that includes a remote access backdoor. Bot may be installed later.</p>
<p> > **2. Your computer must run a program:** Email link, Web page pop-up, download, worm. </p>
<p> > **3. Your computer is vulnerable:** Operating system (keep OS updated), Application. </p>
